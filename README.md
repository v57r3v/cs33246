6 Students investigate osmosis using dialysis tubing. Dialysis tubing is a semipermeable membrane that allows water molecules to pass through while preventing salt ions from passing through.
The students follow this procedure:
1. Mix salt into water to make a 7.1% salt solution.
2. Add equal amounts of this saltwater solution to four small bags made of dialysis tubing.
3. Fill four beakers with different salt solutions, as shown in the image.
4. Place each small bag into one of the four beakers.
5. Observe changes in the size of the bags.
The setup for the investigation is shown.

In which beaker will osmosis cause expansion of the dialysis tubing bag?
A Beaker 1
B Beaker 2
C Beaker 3
D Beaker 4
